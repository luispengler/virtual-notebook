<h4 id="org419c296">Why estimate f?</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org419c296">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Two main reasons: prediction and inference</li>
<li>Linear models allow for relatively simple and interpretable interference, but might not accuratly predict \[Y\]. Some non-linear models present the oppost outcome to linear ones.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-org2f1cec9" class="outline-5">
<h5 id="org2f1cec9">Prediction</h5>
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-org2f1cec9">
<p>
\[\hat{Y} = \hat{f}(X)\]
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The formula above is used to predict the value of \[Y\]. \[\hat{f}\] represents our estimate of \[f\], and \[\hat{Y}\] represents the resulting prediction for \[Y\]. In this setting, \[\hat{f}\] is often treated as a black box, because we are not concerned with its form, as long as it accuratly predicts \[Y\].</li>
<li>The accuracy of \[\hat{Y}\] as a prediction depends on two quantities that the book calls reducible error and irreducible error; the reducible comes from the different between \[\hat{f}\] and \[f\]. This error is reducible because we can improve the accuracy of \[\hat{f}\] using a more appropriate statistical learning technique. The irreducible comes from the dependence of \[Y\] in \[\epsilon\], and this last quantity may contain unmeasured variables that are useful for predicting \[Y\], and since we didn&rsquo;t measure them, the \[Y\] prediction will not be at its best&#x2026;</li>
<li>The book focuses on techniques for estimating \[f\] while minimazing the reducible error (because it is possible!)</li>

</div>
<div id="outline-container-orgbbcb1ef" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="orgbbcb1ef">How do we estimate f?</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgbbcb1ef">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>We want to find a function \[^{f}\] such that \[Y \approx \hat{f}(X)\] for any observation \[(X,Y)\]. Most statistical learning methods for this can be categorized as either paremetric or non-parametric.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h5 id="org3b4f6ee">Parametric</h5>
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-org3b4f6ee">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>It makes assumptions about the form (shape) of \[f\]. Assuming, for example, it is linear, the problem gets simplified to the point where we only need to estimate the \[p + 1\] coefficients of \[\beta_{0}, \beta_{1},....,\beta_{p}\]. In summary, this model-based approach reduces the problem of estimating \[f\] down to one of estimating a set of parameters.</li>

<li>Doesn&rsquo;t make assumptions about the form of \[f\], seeking an estimate that gets as close to the data points as possible without being too rough or wiggly.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgbc0953d">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>In general, as the flexibility of a method increases, its interpretability decreases</li>
<li>If we are more interested in inference, then restrictive models are much more interpretable and better for it</li>
<li>Least squares linear regression is relatively inflexible but is quite interpretable</li>
<li>When we want to predict, it is intuitive that we think we need the most flexible model available. However, this is not always the case due to overfitting of data.</li>

<h4 id="org1340320">Regression versus Classification Problems</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org1340320">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>It is a tendency to refer to quantitative response problems as regression problems, and qualitative ones as classification problems.

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>There is no model that works best for every type of problem out there. Therefore, it is necessary to select the best one that works out for the specific problem you are working with, and this is one of the most challenging parts of performing statistical learning.</li>

<h5 id="org5efcb9a">Measuring the Quality of Fit</h5>
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-org5efcb9a">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>To quantify the extent to which the predicted response value for a given observation is close to the true response for that observation we commonly use the mean squared error (MSE):</li>
</ul>
<p>
\[MSE = \frac{1}{n} \sum\limits_{i=1}^n (y_{i} - \hat{f}(x_{i}))^2\]
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The MSE will be small if the predicted responses are very close to the true responses, and will be large for some observations that the predicted and true responses differ substantially</li>
<li>The formula shown above is computed using the training data, but in reality we don&rsquo;t really care how well our model makes predictions on training data, rather we are interested in the accuracy of the predictions that we obtain when we apply our method to previously unseen test data</li>
<li>We want to choose the method that gives the lowest test MSE, as opposed to the lowest training MSE</li>

<li>If there is no available test dataset, should we apply the method the minimizes the training MSE? Well, there is no guarantee that the method with the lowest training MSE will also have the lowest test MSE. Many statistical learning methods also try to minimize the training MSE, but the test MSE often ends up being much largert</li>
<li>To solve this problem, we can even use some of the training data as the testing data. This is known as cross-validation</li>
<li>As model flexibility increases, training MSE will decrease, but the test MSE may not</li>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>When a given method gives a small training MSE but a large test MSE we say we are overfitting the data.</li>

<h5 id="org1396b0c">The Bias-Variance Trade-Off</h5>
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-org1396b0c">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>In order to minimize the expected test error, we need to select a statistical learning method that simultaneously achieves low variance and low bias.</li>
<li>Variance refers to the amount \[\hat{f}\] would change if we estimated it using different training data. Ideally, the estimate for \[\hat{f}\] should not very much between training sets. If a method has high variance, then small changes in the training set can result in large changes in \[\hat{f}\]. In general, more flexible statistical methods have higher variance</li>
<li>Bias refers to the error that is introduced in approximating a real-life problem, which may be extremely complicated, by a much simpler model. Generally, more flexible statistical methods result in less bias.</li>
<li>Generalizing, as we use more flexible methods, the variance will increase and the bias will decrease. As we increase the flexibility of a class of methods, the bias tends to initially decrease faster than the variance increases, meaning the expected test MSE declines. However, at some point increasing flexibility has little impact on the bias but starts to significantly increase the variance, then the expected test MSE increases. This is known as the Bias-Variance Trade-Off.</li>
<li>Good test set performance of a statistical learning method requires low variance as well as low squared bias. It is refered to as a trade-off, because it is extremely easy to obtain a method with extremly low bias but high variance, or a method with very low variance but high bias. The challenge is finding a method for which both the variance and the squared bias are low.</li>

<li>\[\hat{y}\] is the predicted class label for the \[i\]th observation using \[\hat{f}\]. \[I(\hat y_{i} \neq \hat y_{i})^2\] is an indicator variable that equals 1 if \[\hat y_{i}\] and \[\hat y_{i}\] differ, and it equals 0 if \[\hat y_{i} = \hat y_{i}\]. If \[I(\hat y_{i} \neq \hat y_{i})^2 = 0\] then ith observation was classified correctly, otherwise it was misclassified. Then, the equation above computes the fraction of incorrect classifications. Its name is training error rate, because it is applied to training data. Just like in regression setting, here we are also more interested in the predictions, therefore test error rate will be more useful.</li>

<li>A good classifier is one for which the test error given by the above equation is smallest;</li>
<li>The test error given by the above equation is minimized, on average, by a very simple classifier that assigns each observation to the most likely class, given its predictor values. Simply put, if you had to estimate if X belongs to Brazil or Argentina, the frontier between two countries corresponds to what is known as Bayes decision boundary. In this boundary, the chance of belonging to either side is 50%, and if X is in Brazil, this region is assigned as &gt; 50%.</li>
<li>The Bayes classifier produces the lowest possible test error rate, called Bayes error rate, and it is analogous to the irreducible error</li>
<li>In theory we would always like to use the Bayes classifier, but for real data, we don&rsquo;t know the conditional distribution of \[Y\] given \[X\], so computing the Bayes classifier is impossible.</li>
<li>Therefore, it remains an unattainable gold standard to which we compare other methods. Many approaches try to estimate the conditional distribution of \[Y\] given \[X\], and then classify a given observation to the class with the highest estimated probability. One such method is the K-nearest neighbors (KNN) classifier.</li>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The KNN takes a parameter known as \[K\]. So if \[K=3\], in a dataset, it will get the three closest points to what you are trying to predict, and will determine whether or not what you are trying to predict belongs to a certain classification based on the classification of the three closest points (Because \[K=3\]). If two of the three points are blue, and only one is orange, the KNN will tell you the point you are trying to predict is also blue.</li>
<li>It is a very simple approach, but it can yield results very close to the Bayes classifier</li>
<li>The choice of what \[K\] equals to has drastic effect on the results obtained. If smaller, it is more flexible, and larger, less flexibile. The small K corresponds to a classifier with low bias but very high variance, a large one corresponds to higher bias but lower variance.</li>

<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-orgb02cb6e">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>If \[f\] is to approximated by a linear function, then we can write this relationship as</li>
</ul>
<p>
\[Y = \beta_{0} + \beta{1}X + \epsilon\]
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The error term, \[\epsilon\], is a catch-all for what we miss with this simple model: the true relationship is not linear, there may be other variables that cause variation in Y, and there may be measurement error. We then assume the error term is independent of X. The model given by the eq above defines the population regression line, which is the best linear approximation to the true relationship between X and Y.</li>
<li>The least squares regression coefficient estimates (eq which i did not show here) characterize the least squares line (given by  \[\^y = \beta_{0} + \beta_{1}x\]) (note the \[\beta\] have hat symbols on)</li>
<li>In real applications, we have access to a set of observations from which we can compute the least squares line, however the population regression is unobserved</li>
<li>We can think of the least squares as an analogy to the mean of a sample. The sample is smaller than the population, therefore, deriving the mean from it is different than deriving the mean from the population. An avarage of the sample mean over many data sets, however, will be very close to the population mean. In another situation, a single estimate of the sample mean may be a substantial understimate or overstimate of the population mean. We can even calculate how far this estimate will be with the formula below</li>
</ul>
<p>
\[Var({\hat\mu}) = SE(\hat\mu)^2 = \frac{\sigma^2}{n}\]
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>This formula gives us the standard error of \[\hat\mu\], written as \[SE(\hat \mu)\]. \[\sigma\] is the standard deviation of each of the realizations of \[y_{i}\] of \[Y^2\]. This means that the standard error tells us the avarage amount that this estimate \[\hat \mu\] differs from the actual value of \[\mu\]. To compute the standard error associated with \[\hat \beta_{0}\] and \[\hat \beta_{1}\] we can use some bigger formulas which I will not write here but you can find them on the book as 3.8</li>
<li>In general, \[\sigma^2\] is not known, but can be estimated from the data. This estimate of \[\sigma\] is known as the residual standard error, and it is given by the formula</li>
</ul>
<p>
\[RSE = \sqrt{RSS/(n-2)}\]
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>We should also write \[\hat SE(\hat \beta_{1})\] to indicate that \[\sigma^2\] was estimated from the data.</li>
<li>Standard errors can be used to compute confidence intervals. A 95% confidence interval has the following property: if we take repeated samples and construct the confidence interval for each sample, 95% of the intervals will contain the true unknown value of the paramter. Of course, the greater the range of values, the higher the confidence.</li>
<li>For linear regression, the 95\% confidence interval for \[\beta_{1}\] approximately takes the form</li>
</ul>
<p>
\[\hat \beta_{1} \pm 2\cdot SE(\beta_{1})\]
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>This means that this interval has approximately a 95\% chance to contain the true value of \[beta_{1}\]. The same relation here applies for \[\hat \beta_{0}\].</li>
<li>This part of the book is addressing the hypothesis test on the coefficients, and I didn&rsquo;t stop to understand much of it so I am not writting it here. What I got that is important is the p-value</li>
<li>I have heard of the p-value before, and I was always curious to understand what it meant. I think I finally got a grasp of it when I read:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>
a small p-value indicates that it is unlikely to observe such a substantial association between the predictor and the response due to chance, in the absence of any real association between the predictor and the response. Hence, if we see a small p-value, then we can infer that there is an association between the predictor and the response.
</p>
</blockquote>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>To sum up, small enough p-values tell us that there is a relationship between \[X\] and \[Y\]. Typical values are 5\% or 1\%;</li>

<h5 id="org5399c9f">Assessing the Accuracy of the Model</h5>
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-org5399c9f">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>After we determined the p-value is small enough for us to procede believing in a relationship between \[X\] and \[Y\], we will want to quantify the extent to which the model fits the data.</li>
<li>The quality of a linear regression fit is typically assessed using two related quantities: the residual standard error (RSE) and the \[R^2\] statistic</li>
<li>The RSE is the avarage amount that the response will deviate from the true regression line. This measure is considered a measure of the lack of fit of the model to the data. It attempts to calculate how far off we would be in our predictions, even if we knew exactly the values of \[\beta_{0}\] and \[\beta_{1}\]</li>
<li>In summary, if \[\hat y_{i} \approx y_{i}\] then the RSE will be small, and if \[\hat y_{i}\] is far away, then the RSE may be quite large.</li>
<li>RSE provides an absolute measure of lack of fit of the model to the data. However, it is measured in units of \[Y\], so it is not always clear what constitutes a good RSE. To solve this problem, we can look at the \[R^2\] statistic.</li>
<li>An \[R^2\] statistic close to 1 indicates that a large proportion of the variability in the response is explained by the regression, however a number closer to 0 indicates that this regression does not explain much of the variability in the response. The latter happens when the model is wrong, or the error variance \[\sigma^2\] is high, or both.</li>

<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-org239d91f">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Any time a straight line is fit to a binary response that is codad as 0 or 1, in principle we can always predict \[p(X) < 0\] for some values of \[X\] and \[p(X) > 1\] for others. To avoid this, we must model \[p(X)\] using a function that gives outputs between 0 and 1 for all values of X. Many functions meet this description, and in logistic regression we have the logistic function for this:</li>
</ul>
<p>
\[p(X) = \frac{e^{\beta_{0} + \beta_{1}X}}{1 + e^{\beta_{0} + \beta_{1}X}}\]
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>To fit the model we use a method called maximum likelihood. Its intuition is as follows:</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>
we seek estimates for \[\beta_{0}\] and \[\beta_{1}\] such that the predicted probability \[\hat p(x_{i})\] of default for each individual, using the logistic function, corresponds as closely as possible to the individual&rsquo;s observed default status. In other words, we try to find \[\hat \beta_{0}\] and \[\hat \beta_{1}\] such that plubbing these estimates into the model for \[p(X)\], given in the logistic function, yields a number close to one for all individuals who defaulted, and a number close to zero for all individuals who did not.
