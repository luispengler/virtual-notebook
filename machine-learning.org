* Introduction
So, my mentor gave me my first task to learn some stuff around NumPy, Panda, and Scikit-Learn until Sunday (today is Thursday). But he also said some stuff about watching StatQuest YouTube videos about Machine Learning
+ My mentor is [[https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=cHCDiIYAAAAJ][Dr. Abhijit Sen]], and we are starting research through the project [[https://www.ndeavours.org/][Ndeavours]]
+ Keep tuned for updates into what we are doing - I don't know yet because we just started, but it will have something to do with AI.

* Decision Tree and Black Line
+ They are a simple machine learning method
+ Their purpose is to predict something, or classify someone/something
** Deriving Machine Learning
+ With decision trees and black lines we can see that generaly machine learning is all about making predictions and classifications
* Main ideas
+ The original data is called training data
+ The black line is fit to training data, but we could also use the green squiggle
+ But how much better is the green squiggle than the black line? To determine this we need testing data
+ The testing data is used to compare the predictions made by the black line to the predicitons made by the green squiggle
+ Summing the diference of the real data vs the predicted data by the black line and the green squiggle is a way we can tell which one predicts better (in ML we are more interested in a model predicting better than it fitting the training data better)
** Summarizing
+ First, we use Testing Data to evaluate Machine Learning methods
+ Second, don't be fooled by how well a Machine Learning method fits the Training Data
+ Note: Fitting the Training Data well but making poor predictions is called the Bias-Variance Tradeoff
